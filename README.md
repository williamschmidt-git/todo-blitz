## Development

In the proccess i used the TDD to develop the backend part, and tried to apply the MVC architeture using SOLID principles. In the frontend, i did a very basic react setup, using Hooks and Context, to provide to them the request from the backend. The project is far from finished, but the backend part has a solid start.
